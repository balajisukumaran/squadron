C++</h2><p>
&#39;C++&#39;, a general-purpose programming language, is an extension of &#39;C&#39; Language with the
additional built in features. It is called as an intermediate language because it consists of both
high level languages such as Object Oriented Programming and middle level language like &#39;C&#39;.
Unlike &#39;C&#39;, C++ is more secured and combines power and flexibility of &#39;C&#39;. It has the advantage
of code reusability and strong Data structure concepts. C++ language is used to create different
kinds of software such as server software, general systems software, embedded software,
application software and also used in creating video games in different environments like Linux,
Unix and Windows.
C++ Training is very much essential to anybody who wants to be a programmer. The concepts of
programming language and the features of object oriented programming are so well explained at
Squadrone, that we lay a concrete foundation to your programming career. A systematic teaching
methodology is followed so that the students can comfortably understand the differences,
advantages and additional features of C++ over C. At Squadrone  C++ training institute, we
impart good logical understanding on the programming language syntax through practical
execution of programs. Knowledge on C++ will help you migrate to .Net or Java with ease.</p> 
<h2>Core JAVA</h2>
<p>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language which is developed by Sun Microsystem. It
is platform independent language. Core Java is a concept to write once can be used anywhere.
Without compiling the code it can be used on another platform if it the code is written for one
platform. Java can be used in both Client Server as well as Web-based Application. We can use
Core Java in many technologies like Selenium, Hadoop, Sales Force, Data Analytics, etc. It has
the different concept of Collection, Swing, Multithreading, etc which help in the building of
Stand-Alone Application. It is very flexible and can be used to develop Software as well as
Applets. It is also used to develop Mobile Application, Desktop Application, Web Application,
Security driven Application, etc. This Core Java Online Training is conducted by Real-Time Experts.</p>

<h2>Advanced JAVA</h2>
<p>Advance Java is an advance programing language which is developed by Sun Microsystem. Advance Java can be used for developing different Application like: Web-based, Desktop based and Mobile based application.  It also uses Servlets.  It usually covers many functionalities like Associative data structure, Classic data structure, sorting and searching, etc.  Also, by Advance Java, Networking programming and GUI development can be done.  Advance java covers the processing of XML using API’s. Advance Java course build a strong knowledge of HTML, XML, JSP, JDBC and JSTL technologies. Also it covers the J2EE design pattern. Advance Java online training gives strong knowledge in the resolve of memory leakage problem, session tracking information, etc.

<h2>C#.Net
</h2>
<p>
C# is the most popularly used programming language for developing different types of .net applications. As per todays trend, C# has more demand. C# is an Object Oriented Programming language, It is introduced specifically for .NET and thus has no backward compatibility issues.
Squadrone  C# Training course is the entry level program for all those beginners who are looking for a career in .net and thus will have to begin with developing command over the programming language syntax. At our C# Training Institute, our course not only helps one in understanding language syntax but it also helps in knowing good practices to become a successful software developer. At our C# training in Hyderabad, teaching methodology is such that our trainers will ease teach participants C# language use the same interchangeably for other advanced topics like XML, ADO.NET, Win Forms etc... We assure you that learning C# will surely make you a better candidate to get job than most of the other fresher's who learn only one programming language.
C# Training at Squadrone  includes detailed explanation of every topic covering all the concepts related to the topic and is followed by practical demonstration / walkthrough of the same in classroom. Students in classroom will be provided with excellent course material prepared by our expert team so that the same can be used for revising the subject at later point of time (may be just before attending an interview). Our C# training center provides excellent course material which contains important points about the topic, sample programs and walkthroughs. These will help the participant to practice the examples independently and develop expertise in the subject knowledge.</p>
<h2>Android Development</h2>
<p>
Android is the mobile operating system developed by Google. It is a combination of middle-ware and key applications. Using android we can develop mobile and tablet supported applications. It is Linux based software system similar to Linux, and is a free and open source software. Using Android we can develop two types of applications Native and Hybrid Applications. JAVA technology is used to develop Android applications as JAVA is platform independent. For developing Android Application Android SDK and Eclipse IDE are required.
Android training at Squadrone  provides an efficient way to learn the course completely and gain very good knowledge. This course will mainly focus on explaining all the topics by using sample examples for every topic hence allows the beginners to understand the course very easily. In our Android Development Training we provide a series of walk-through's & lab assignments which introduce and explain Android features that are used to code, debug and deploy Native Mobile applications.
